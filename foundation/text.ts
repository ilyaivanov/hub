Uniform randomness often isn’t the most thoughtful solution to a design problem—in particular, the kind of problem that involves building an organic or natural-looking simulation. With a few tricks, however, the random() function can instead produce nonuniform distributions ofrandom numbers, where some outcomes are more likely than others. This type of distribution can yield more interesting, seemingly natural results.

Think about when you first started programming with p5.js. Perhaps you wanted to draw a lot of circles on the screen, so you said to yourself, “Oh, I know! I’ll draw all these circles at random positions, with random sizes and random colors.” Seeding a system with randomness is a perfectly reasonable starting point when you’re learning the basics of computer graphics.

Creating a nonuniform distribution ofrandom numbers will come in handy throughout the book. In Chapter 9’s genetic algorithms, for example, I’ll need a methodology for performing selection—which members ofthe population should be selected to pass their DNA to the next generation? This is akin to the Darwinian concept ofsurvival of the fittest. Say you have an evolving population ofmonkeys. Not every monkey has an equal chance ofreproducing. To simulate Darwinian natural selection, you can’t simply pick two random monkeys to be parents. The more “fit” ones should be more likely to be chosen. This could be considered the probability ofthefittest.
